### **Case Study: Unlocking Financial Insights in Banking Data**

### **Background**

As a data analyst at FinInsight Group, a consultancy specializing in banking analytics, you are equipped with two comprehensive datasets: 'Banking Transactions' and 'Customer Account Details'. The 'Banking Transactions' dataset records detailed transaction data, including types, amounts, dates, and branch information. The 'Customer Account Details' dataset provides insights into account holders, covering account types, balances, interest rates, credit scores, and loan amounts.

### **Objective**

Employ Power BI to analyze these banking datasets, unraveling intricate patterns and behaviors. This involves data cleaning, modeling, and using DAX for complex analytics. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard illustrating transactional trends, customer profiles, and the banking ecosystem. Analysis should include customer transaction behaviors, relationships between account characteristics and financial health, and factors influencing credit scores and loan management. Insights will guide FinInsight Group in advising banks on optimizing services, enhancing satisfaction, and managing risks.

## Banking Analysis Project

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the Banking Analysis Project. This project leverages Power BI to provide insightful analysis of banking datasets, focusing on transactional trends, customer profiles, and the overall banking ecosystem. The analysis is divided into three main sections: Transaction and Amount Analysis, Interest Rates, Credit Scores, and Loan Analysis, and Branch and Customer Analysis. These insights aim to guide FinInsight Group in advising banking institutions on optimizing services, enhancing customer satisfaction, and managing financial risks.

### **Sections**

1. **Transaction and Amount Analysis**
   - This section focuses on examining transaction types, amounts, and patterns over time. The analysis includes categorizing transactions into broader categories, investigating high-value transactions, and understanding trends across different time periods. Additionally, it involves currency conversion to standardize transaction amounts for better comparison.

2. **Interest Rates, Credit Scores, and Loan Analysis**
   - In this section, the relationship between interest rates, account balances, and loan amounts is analyzed. The correlation between credit scores and loan amounts is examined to understand customer credit behavior. This analysis helps in identifying the impact of interest rates on account balances and understanding how credit scores influence loan management.

3. **Branch and Customer Analysis**
   - This section provides insights into branch performance and customer behaviors. It involves analyzing branch activity, identifying the most active branches, and evaluating customer loyalty based on account duration. The section also includes extracting and analyzing customer demographics to understand their influence on transaction behaviors and account characteristics.
