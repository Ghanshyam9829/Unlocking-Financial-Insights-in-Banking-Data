### **Case Study: Unlocking Financial Insights in Banking Data**

### **Background**

As a data analyst at FinInsight Group, a consultancy specializing in banking analytics, you are equipped with two comprehensive datasets: 'Banking Transactions' and 'Customer Account Details'. The 'Banking Transactions' dataset records detailed transaction data, including types, amounts, dates, and branch information. The 'Customer Account Details' dataset provides insights into account holders, covering account types, balances, interest rates, credit scores, and loan amounts.

### **Objective**

Employ Power BI to analyze these banking datasets, unraveling intricate patterns and behaviors. This involves data cleaning, modeling, and using DAX for complex analytics. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard illustrating transactional trends, customer profiles, and the banking ecosystem. Analysis should include customer transaction behaviors, relationships between account characteristics and financial health, and factors influencing credit scores and loan management. Insights will guide FinInsight Group in advising banks on optimizing services, enhancing satisfaction, and managing risks.
